# FlowchartGen

YAML-based programming language developed and designed in collaboration with the research laboratories of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia with the aim of simplifying the operation of creating flowcharts.

The entire project is based on three separate files: 
- The `console.yaml` file is the user interface for writing code. 
- The `parser.py` file allows the code to be converted to the DOT language.
- Finally, the `output.dot` file contains the resulting DOT code.
